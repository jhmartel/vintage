# *How to Sell Vintage Clothing with Generative Matchmaking*

The vintage clothing market suffers from a large gap between supply and demand, especially with respect to quality *men's* clothing as we explain below. *The vintage seller has to know what the client wants before they show up!* And here enters the opportunity for a generative model.

*"Show me what you like, and I'll show you what you want."*

In the vintage problem we want to construct and generate the utility or preference pairings $b(x,y)$ between item $x$ and buyer $y$. The goal is to predict whether the buyer will be hot or cold towards the item. 

The standard model for vintage storefront is: you have random clothes in racks, you expect buyers to show up on location, search through the racks, identify an item which appeals to them which they are willing to purchase at the market price. There appears to us many potential "points of failure" in the chain of sale.

We think that men specifically want a customized mannequin, they want the vintage store to dress the mannequin completely in outfits and ensembles which appeal to the preferences of the buyer. *Is it too much to ask?*
