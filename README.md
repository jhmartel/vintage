How to Sell Vintage: Matchmaking Generators

We have an idea here, born from experience in my own personal search for quality used men's clothing. 
There is large market of vintage sellers, who mainly focus on women's clothing. This is because of many "environmental" supply factors. In our opinion a new strategy needs be provided or attempted to expand their markets and sell to men.
We experienced many shops in Calgary, specifically, which did not have any men's selection. So here is opportunity. 

Remark. There is another strategy among vintage shops to market their clothing as "unisexual". But we think this will have inherent limitations in expanding the number of male buyers. We must be forgiven that this memo is based on a chauvinist strategy, again based on experience. 

Here is the outline of the whole idea:

In vintage clothing market there are big gaps between supply and demand, i.e. the supply of quality used clothing acquired by the vintage sellers, and the demand of the buyers market. In this memo we are specifically interested in *male buyers*. Here specifically the gap is largest. The popular idiom is that "men hate shopping". And yes, they do. They do not want to waste their time searching through random racks for items that may or may not be there, which may or may not fit, etc.. Other people find this part of vintage hunting fun, but our working assumption is that the majority of men do not enjoy this.

Men are judgemental and mission oriented. So they want to immediately be catered to. In and out. A client shows up, with a profile, with some portfolio for their style, and you have to generate matchings for them from the available stockpile supply. 

# Statement of Problem

In the vintage problem we want to construct and generate the utility or preference pairings $b(x,y)$ between item $x$ and buyer $y$. I.e., we look to predict whether the buyer will be hot or cold towards the item. Will the client have a disposition, with some probability reflected in $b(x,y)$, to trade scarce resources for the item?
Basically the vintage seller has a supply $X$, which is not well known and very opaque to the buyers $Y$. A buyer $y$ walks into the store, they have a null feeling to mostly everything except they react to the mannequins, etc.. The buyer has no sense of the client's preferences. The buyer did not even know this buyer exists before they physically walk into the store.


The standard model for vintage storefront is: you have random clothes in racks, you expect buyers to show up on location, search through the racks, identify an item which appeals to them which they are willing to purchase at the market price. There appears to us many potential "points of failure" in the chain of sale.

We think that men specifically want a customized mannequin, they want the vintage store to dress the mannequin completely in outfits and ensembles which appeal to the preferences of the buyer. Is it too much to ask?


Instagram is filled with girls who pick and sell vintage clothing. Here "vintage" could mean a premium literally "vintage" limited edition shirt, or vintage could mean a quality used clothing item which typically is not in production anymore. These sellers have a large supply of clothing, i.e. large stockpile. They pick from huge random bins alongside other pickers, and it's not at all clear what's going to sell. And who are they picking for?

This is a direct question to ask: do vintage stores pick clothes with the *hope* that the item is going to sell, with the hope that the right person is going to walk through the door and fall in love with it? We can do better.
