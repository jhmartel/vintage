    "# *How to Sell Vintage Clothing with Generative Matchmaking*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to generate the market conditions to sell more vintage items to more buyers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The vintage clothing market suffers from a large gap between supply and demand, especially with respect to quality *used men*'s clothing as we explain below. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have an idea born from our searches for quality used men's clothing. There is large market of vintage sellers, who mainly focus on women's clothing, and one often finds shops which do not have *any* men's selection. So here is opportunity. The market demand *is* there. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this memo we are specifically interested in *male buyers*, and we propose that a distinct strategy needs be developed to connect vintage markets to male buyers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The popular idiom is that \"men hate shopping\". And yes, they do. \n",
    "\n",
    "But why? \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a psychological element here. Basically men are mission oriented and judgemental. They do not want to waste their time searching through random racks for items that may or may not be there, which may or may not fit, at this or that price, etc.. Other people find this part of vintage hunting fun, but our working assumption is that the majority of men do *not* enjoy this. This makes for barrier between male buyers and the vintage stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to be matchmakers, and connect the market. Men *want* to look good, and vintage shops are *able* to make them look good. This is our objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Men want to immediately be catered to. In and out. A client shows up, with a profile, with some portfolio for their style, and you have to generate matchings for them from the available stockpile supply. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You (the vintage seller) has to know what the client wants before they show up!* \n",
    "\n",
    "And here enters the opportunity for a generative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Statement of Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the vintage problem we want to construct and generate the utility or preference pairings $b(x,y)$ between item $x$ and buyer $y$. I.e., we look to predict whether the buyer will be \"hot\" or \"cold\" towards the item. Will the client have a disposition, with some probability reflected in $b(x,y)$, to trade scarce resources for the item?\n",
    "\n",
    "The vintage seller has a supply $X$, which is not well known and very opaque to the buyers $Y$. A buyer $y$ walks into the store, they have a null feeling to mostly everything except they react to the mannequins, etc.. The buyer has no sense of the client's preferences. The buyer did not even know this buyer exists before they physically walked into the store.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard model for vintage storefront is: you have random clothes in racks, you expect buyers to show up on location, search through the racks, identify an item which appeals to them which they are willing to purchase at the market price. There appears to us many potential \"points of failure\" in the chain of sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "We think that men specifically want a customized mannequin, they want the vintage store to dress the mannequin completely in outfits and ensembles which appeal to the preferences of the buyer. Is it too much to ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instagram is filled with girls who pick and sell vintage clothing. Here \"vintage\" could mean a premium literally \"vintage\" limited edition shirt, or vintage could mean a quality used clothing item which typically is not in production anymore. These sellers have a large supply of clothing, i.e. large stockpile. They pick from huge random bins alongside other pickers, and it's not at all clear what's going to sell. And who are they picking for?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a direct question to ask: do vintage stores pick clothes with the *hope* that the item is going to sell, with the hope that the right person is going to walk through the door and fall in love with it? We can do better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given measures $\\sigma, \\tau$ on the supply $X$ and buyers $Y$, respectively. This means we don't have precise pointwise knowledge about $X,Y$, but rather measurable (\"probabilistic\") information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume/postulate/hypothesize the existence of a reasonable stable preference pairing $$b: X\\times Y \\to \\bf{R}.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The function $b$ is some qualitative (!) measure of the \"temperature\" $b(x,y)$ of buyer $y$ towards an item $x$. Naively we want to maximize the temperature, and emphasize (i.e. market, target, upsell) those items which make the client \"warm\" and more likely to buy. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the challenge is to generate this temperature $b$, to know the supply items $x$ which even appeal to the buyer $y$, and even know the temperatures of items with confidence before the buyer walks into the store and sees the item!\n",
    "\n",
    "We formulate the problem as generating the preference temperature functions $b=b(x,y)$ with confidence for new supply items $x$ and buyers $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Parameters\n",
    "Here enters the quantitative part and this is more difficult. \n",
    "*What are the relevant numerical statistics in the vintage problem?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently the buyer has personal features, like their height, waist size, etc. (physical dimensions), but also their aesthetics or style palette, etc.. Personally i like matching colour combinations, even of purples and reds and extreme colours, and am looking for such combinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, a buyer could walk in the door, we share their instagram, then we examine and review and extract the style palette from the user's instragram, and then generate a supply recommendation for the client. Direct the client towards items which we have some reasonable expectation of the client's being *warm* towards. \n"

    "# Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*What does the \"picking environment\" look like these days?* \n",
    "\n",
    "I've been told all the bins have already been picked over, that quality items are not readily found. Ourselves we also imagine the picking environment is frantic and the supply is random. This makes it difficult for the vintage sellers to *choose* those items which form their selling supply. Vintage sellers need make frantic hurried snap judgements on the items, based on their own tastes and impressions. It's possible that the sellers have their own style templates, and motifs in their minds, either explicitly or implicitly. Our goal in this project is to somehow make the motifs and style templates more explicit and descriptive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buyers have almost no visibility into the supply of vintage sellers*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is significant bottleneck in the vintage setting. Vintage collectors have large collections which are unseen and which cannot really be queried by potential buyers. In the usual storefront setting, items are sold only if the item is placed on the rack, and the buyer enters the store, browses the rack, sees an item, recognizes that they want the item, and decides to purchase. \n",
    "\n",
    "Too many steps here! The seller should know what to sell the client before they enter the store!\n",
    "\n",
    "We think it's a losing or limited strategy to rely on people physically browsing through the racks in the storefront. We can do better. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the generative model is to have recommendations for the buyers before they even enter the store! The buyers have a taste profile, and candidate items which positively correlate with the taste profile need be suggested to the buyers. Easier said than done, but we see a way.\n",
